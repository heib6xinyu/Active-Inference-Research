# Active Inference Research Archive

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive archive of my research and experiments in the field of Active Inference. Active Inference is a theoretical framework in neuroscience and psychology that postulates that the brain minimizes a quantity called free energy as a way of improving its model of the world.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains various projects and experiments that explore different aspects of Active Inference, using computational models and simulations to validate theories and hypotheses.

### Projects
- [Variational Autoencoder for HalfCheetah-v4 Environment](https://github.com/heib6xinyu/Active-Inference-Research/tree/master/4_24_2024%20Variational%20Autoencoder%20for%20HalfCheetah-v4%20Environment): An implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to model and predict the dynamics of the "HalfCheetah-v4" environment from the OpenAI Gym toolkit. This project uses the JAX library to leverage automatic differentiation and efficient computation.
